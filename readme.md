## Description
Welcome to the long awaited Next.js and React course from Cod3r!

In this course we'll talk about the framework that runs on top of the most famous library of today, React, and that adds a lot of features to it. Several large companies are already using Next, which will be a great addition to your resume, learning this amazing technology!

You will learn Next in practice in a course totally based on projects from the simplest to the most complex. We will cover not only the basics of Next and its main features, but we will also teach you React, going through an overview of the library.

After that, the course will focus on several projects that will do Firebase integration, and we will also have projects with backend as this is a possibility that Next provides. You will also learn how to deploy your projects in the cloud, and in the end we will deliver a responsive application model, with theme change (dark and light), login, authentication, route protection, and all this so you can use it as a base for your own projects! The course is divided into sections and we will have:

- An overview on React, where we will create a project using the basics of component, jsx, fragment. We will do css integration and have a project where we will draw a checkerboard to demonstrate how to organize the components. We will cover conditionals and loops, functions and integrate with Typescript.

- Next we will have an introduction to NextJS in fact, where we will create a base project to work on the structure of the project, the organization of files and folders. We'll learn about routes, navigation between pages, talk about the api and integration with it, and cover rendering strategies, and resolving possible warnings.

- Next we will start our first project, where we will create new components. We will learn about box sizing, integrating the project with typescript, adding events to the project, use router, and do form validations. We will also learn more about SSR, Server Side Rendering. We will look at rendering strategies and how SPA, SSR and SSG strategies work. And we will create a new project and in it learn about static and dynamic components.

- Then we will have a project with a focus on FullStack, that is, we will also have a project with the backend. We will work with api building, mess with json files and work on the project's visuals as well.

- And to finish we will have a section where we will deploy the applications in the cloud. We are delivering in this course a very valuable content, which can make a lot of difference in your career as a programmer.

Let's learn together, I'll be waiting for you in the course.
